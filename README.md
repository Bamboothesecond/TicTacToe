# TicTacToe
*By Bamboothesecond
*The TicTacToe Python program is a graphical user interface (GUI) application that allows the user to play a game of Tic Tac Toe against an opponent (2 Player Game). The *program is written using the tkinter and pygame modules in Python. The program creates a 3x3 grid of buttons on the screen, representing the Tic Tac Toe board. The user *can click on a button to place their "X" or "O" symbol on the board, depending on whose turn it is. The program checks for a winner or a draw after each move, and *displays the result in a message box. If the user chooses to play again, the program resets the board and starts a new game. The program also includes sound effects and *an icon.
